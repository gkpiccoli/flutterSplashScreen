# flutter_app

## Preview

Using Flutter was created a splash screen when apps start.

![Example](https://github.com/gkpiccoli/flutterSplashScreen/blob/main/appteste.gif)


## What I learned creating a splash screen in Flutter:

- Switch over Stateless or Statefull widgets;
- Edit pubspec.yml dependencies;
- Imported pub.dev packages;
- Create a animated gif on Linux;
- Insert a animated gif on README.md;
